/*
The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

- Store the following into variables:
  number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.

- Output your fortune to the screen like so:
  "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

// write your solution here...

var N = 3;

var Z = "Mrs Sanchez";

var Y = "Fort Lauderdale";

var X = "Programmer";

console.log("You will be a "+ X+ " in " + Y + ", and married\
 to " + Z + " with " + N + " kids.");
