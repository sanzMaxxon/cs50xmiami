/*
The Temperature Converter

It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here:
http://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html

- Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
- Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."

// write your solution here...
var celTemp = 31;
var farTemp = celTemp * 9 / 5 + 32;
console.log(celTemp + "\xB0C is " + farTemp + "\xB0F");
var newFarTemp = 89;
var newCelTemp = (newFarTemp -32) * 5 / 9;
console.log(newFarTemp + "\xB0F is " + newCelTemp + "\xB0C");
